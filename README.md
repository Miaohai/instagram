I follow this article to setup flask and mongodb https://dev.to/paurakhsharma/flask-rest-api-part-0-setup-basic-crud-api-4650n

#Step 1
Pipfile contains the packages that are required for your application
For example run pipenv install, flask to get the packages

To run the app, first, enable the virtual environment
-pipenv shell
-python app.py

You can use Postman to test the end point such as 
http://localhost:5000/api/profiles method ('Get)-> to display all the instagram profiles
